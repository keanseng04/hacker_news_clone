We're going to build a Hacker News clone in Sinatra. This will be the most fully-featured web application we've built so far. Excited?!
<h2>Part 1: Users, Posts and Comments</h2>
Design the flow to be as similar to Hacker News as possible. We'll add one exception: comments don't need to be threaded. But the rest should be similar to Hacker News: users, posts, and comments. Do not implement votes in this version.
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<h3>Wireframes</h3>
This application is big enough you should spend time wireframing it. Wireframe the following pages:
<ol>
	<li>An index page listing all the posts</li>
	<li>A page showing a particular post, including comments</li>
	<li>A user profile page</li>
	<li>A page showing all a user's submissions</li>
	<li>A page showing all a user's comments</li>
	<li>A user signup and login page</li>
</ol>
<h3>Models &amp; Controllers</h3>
At the very least you should have the following models:
<ol>
	<li><code>Post</code></li>
	<li><code>User</code></li>
	<li><code>Comment</code></li>
</ol>
Don't worry about threaded comments, unless you're feeling adventurous. Even if you are feeling adventurous, trying to implement threaded comments now might derail your momentum: wait until you have a non-threaded version working before you try your hand at a threaded version.

Also, don't worry about Hacker News' fancy sorting algorithms for the post homepage and comment threads. Just sort them in some simple way: chronologically, alphabetically, etc.
<h3>Views</h3>
Implement all the views. Don't worry about AJAX at first.
